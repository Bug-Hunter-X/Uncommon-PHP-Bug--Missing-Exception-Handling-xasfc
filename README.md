This repository demonstrates a common but easily overlooked bug in PHP code: the lack of robust exception handling. The initial `calculateSum` function is susceptible to errors if the input array contains non-numeric values or is not an array at all.  The improved version showcases the use of `try-catch` blocks to handle these scenarios gracefully, providing more reliable and predictable behavior.  This is crucial for building robust PHP applications.
